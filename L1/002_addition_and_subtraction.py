    # You can't do X(Y), as that would try to invoke a function. (later lesson)
    # You can however, just simply add the multiplicate sign, aka *, instead.

    # Modulus uses the percentage symbol (Shift + 5).
    # In radically simplified terms, the % symbol gets the remainder of the #
    #   by the given number.
